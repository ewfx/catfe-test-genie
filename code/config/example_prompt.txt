**Example #1 Input**:
Description: As a loan officer, I want the system to evaluate customer loan applications based on creditworthiness and risk conditions so that we approve low-risk loans and reject high-risk ones efficiently.
Acceptance Criteria:
1. Approve loans for applicants with credit scores >= 750, DTI <= 0.35, and income >= $50,000.
2. Reject loans for applicants with credit scores < 650 or DTI > 0.43.
3. Flag loans for manual review if credit score is 650-749 and loan amount > $100,000.
4. Ensure loan amount is between $1,000 and $1,000,000.
5. Assign interest rates based on credit score ranges (3% for excellent, 5% for good, etc.).

**Analysis**:
- The feature focuses on evaluating loan applications based on creditworthiness (credit score, DTI, income) and risk conditions (loan amount), with specific criteria for approval, rejection, manual review, and interest rate assignment.
- This aligns with the "Loan & Credit Risk Assessment" use case, which involves AI-driven simulation of customer creditworthiness and scenario testing for loan approval/rejection under different risk conditions.

**Example #2 Input**:
Description: As a bank, we need a fraud detection risk scoring system to identify and assess the risk associated with customer transactions.
Acceptance Criteria:
- The system must calculate a risk score based on predefined rules and transaction data.
- Risk scores should range from 0 (low risk) to 100 (high risk).
- The system must generate a real-time risk score for each transaction attempted by a customer.
- The risk score must be calculated using customer behavior data, transaction history, and external data (e.g., IP address, location, etc.).
- The risk scoring algorithm must be updated periodically based on emerging fraud patterns.

**Analysis**:
- The feature focuses on calculating real-time risk scores for transactions using predefined rules, customer behavior, and external data, with periodic updates to the algorithm based on fraud patterns.
- This aligns with the "Fraud Detection & Risk Scoring" use case, which involves mimicking evolving fraud patterns and evaluating system responses to fraudulent transactions.

**Generated Test Cases**:
Scenario: Calculate low-risk score for a standard transaction
  Given the system is integrated with transaction data
  And a transaction has a small amount, usual location, and standard customer behavior
  When the transaction is processed
  Then the system should calculate a risk score between 0 and 30
  And the risk score should be displayed as low risk in real-time

Scenario: Calculate high-risk score for an unusual transaction
  Given the system is integrated with transaction data
  And a transaction has a large amount, foreign location, and atypical customer behavior
  When the transaction is processed
  Then the system should calculate a risk score between 71 and 100
  And the risk score should be displayed as high risk in real-time

Scenario: Update risk scoring algorithm with new fraud patterns
  Given the system uses an initial risk scoring algorithm
  And new fraud patterns are detected in transaction data
  When the system updates the algorithm periodically
  Then the system should recalculate risk scores using the updated algorithm
  And the recalculated scores should reflect the latest fraud patterns

Scenario: Handle invalid transaction data
  Given the system is processing a transaction
  And the transaction data is missing location information
  When the transaction is processed
  Then the system should return an error message indicating missing data
  And the transaction should not be assigned a risk score

**Example #3 Input**:
Description: As a bank, we need a fraud detection risk scoring system to identify and assess the risk associated with customer transactions.
Acceptance Criteria:
- The system must calculate a risk score based on predefined rules and transaction data.
- Risk scores should range from 0 (low risk) to 100 (high risk).
- The system must generate a real-time risk score for each transaction attempted by a customer.
- The risk score must be calculated using customer behavior data, transaction history, and external data (e.g., IP address, location, etc.).
- The risk scoring algorithm must be updated periodically based on emerging fraud patterns.

**Analysis**:
- This feature is identical to Example #2 in terms of description and acceptance criteria. However, the expected output in the original document focuses on data integration rather than risk scoring directly, suggesting a different intent (e.g., fetching transaction data for scoring).
- For consistency with the "Fraud Detection & Risk Scoring" use case, I’ll adapt the test cases to focus on data integration as a prerequisite for risk scoring, aligning with the original output.

**Generated Test Cases**:
Scenario: Fetch real-time transaction data for risk scoring
  Given the system is integrated with the core banking system
  And a new transaction is processed
  When the transaction data is fetched
  Then the system should retrieve transaction details in real-time including amount, date, and customer data
  And the data should be available for risk scoring

Scenario: Handle successful data integration
  Given the system is integrated with the core banking system
  And transaction data is fetched successfully
  When the data is processed
  Then the system should confirm successful retrieval
  And the transaction data should be visible in the fraud detection dashboard within 1 second

Scenario: Handle data fetch failure
  Given the system is integrated with the core banking system
  And a network issue prevents data retrieval
  When the system attempts to fetch transaction data
  Then the system should log an error message
  And the system should retry fetching the data after a 5-second interval

Scenario: Verify data integrity for risk scoring
  Given the system is integrated with the core banking system
  And transaction data is fetched
  When the data is processed
  Then the system should verify the data is complete and correct
  And the system should log an error if any data is missing or corrupted

- The system must support customizable thresholds based on transaction type, amount, and customer profile.

**Analysis**:
- The feature focuses on sending real-time alerts for transactions exceeding risk thresholds, with customizable thresholds and detailed alert content.
- This aligns with the "Fraud Detection & Risk Scoring" use case, specifically the aspect of evaluating system responses to fraudulent transactions.

**Generated Test Cases**:
Scenario: Trigger alert for high-risk transaction
  Given the system has a risk threshold of 70
  And a transaction has a risk score of 85
  When the transaction is processed
  Then the system should trigger a real-time alert
  And the alert should include transaction details, risk score, and recommended action "review"
  And the alert should be sent via email and SMS

Scenario: No alert for low-risk transaction
  Given the system has a risk threshold of 70
  And a transaction has a risk score of 50
  When the transaction is processed
  Then the system should not trigger an alert

Scenario: Custom threshold alert for large withdrawal
  Given the system has a custom threshold of 60 for withdrawals
  And a withdrawal transaction has a risk score of 65
  When the transaction is processed
  Then the system should trigger an alert
  And the alert should include transaction details and recommended action "hold"

Scenario: Alert with incomplete data
  Given the system has a risk threshold of 70
  And a transaction with missing customer details has a risk score of 75

**Generated Test Cases**:
Scenario: Flag unusual large transaction
  Given the system has historical data showing typical transactions of $100-$500
  And a customer initiates a transaction of $5,000 from an unfamiliar location
  When the transaction is processed
  Then the system should flag the transaction as suspicious
  And the system should explain the flag due to the large amount and unusual location

Scenario: Flag high-frequency transactions
  Given the system monitors customer transaction frequency
  And a customer performs 10 transactions within 5 minutes
  When the transactions are processed
  Then the system should flag the transactions as suspicious
  And the system should explain the flag due to high frequency

Scenario: Update fraud model with new data
  Given the system uses a fraud detection model
  And new transaction data shows a pattern of frequent small transfers
  When the system processes the new data
  Then the system should update the fraud detection model automatically
  And the updated model should flag similar patterns as suspicious

Scenario: No flag for typical transaction
  Given the system has historical data showing typical transactions of $100-$500
  And a customer initiates a transaction of $200 from a usual location
  When the transaction is processed
  Then the system should not flag the transaction as suspicious
